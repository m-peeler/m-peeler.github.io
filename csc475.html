<h1>Senior Seminar Project Proposal</h1>
<h2>Furman Now App Renovations</h2>
<h3>1 Proposal</h3>
<h4>1.1 Background</h4>
In 2020 and 2021, Professor Bryan Catron worked with 4 students to develop both an iOS and
Android mobile application entitled "Furman Now!‚Äù, intended to collate various important links,
events, contacts, news, and other information related to the University. [1] However, due to iOS API
changes, revisions to the Furman University websites, and a variety of other factors, the iOS app has
been removed from the app store and various web scrappers have stopped working. Additionally,
design on the app, already dated when it was created, has only continued to age.
<h4>1.2 Goal</h4>
The goals for this project can be divided into three key sections:
<br>1. Restoration: The first priority of the project is restoring data streams to working conditions
by rewriting the web scrapers that were built in 2020 and 2021. Part of this will include
bringing the codebase more into line with "clean code" standards, including more abstraction,
decoupling, and standardization of the code to updates or adding additional schedules easier
in the future. Currently a variety of information is scrapped from the web, including:
<ul>
 <li>Athletic game dates, times, locations, and scores upon completion. </li>
 <li>University-wide calendar events.</li>
 <li>Location data and estimated times of arrival for the Greenville 503 bus, which has an
on-campus stop, and the on-campus shuttle. </li>
 <li>Hours of operations for various on-campus locations such as Trone, the PAC, restaurants, and the Duke Library. </li>
 <li>Daily menus at the various stations of the Dining Hall.</li>
 <li>Campus weather.</li>
<ul>
As part of these edits, I will aim to improve stability of all web information access
systems to implement better logging systems, automatically monitor the status of scrapers
to provide some sort of indication when one is broken, and decouple parts of the
code so that one website being changed does not cause the whole script to break. Of
high priority is ensuring that information related to communal transportation remains
readily accessible, particularly with regards to the on-campus shuttle; not only do
app users report regularly using that feature to know when it will be arriving, there are
also potential health and environmental benefits to increasing availability of this information.
<br>
A previous study in Clemson indicated that knowing where transit vehicles are and
how long it will be before they will arrive at a stop leads to more willingness to simply
walk to the location instead of sitting around for the vehicle, somewhat increasing
student activity. [2] Further, the same study found that increased access to transit location
information decreased the amount of time people had to wait at stops, Additionally, other
studies have found that increased access to data for real-time transit locations increases
